5. Ranger Shortcuts:

	Use spacebar to select files one by one. "V" to perform visual selection, "v" reverses current selection. For instance, you can run :delete after selecting multiple files and folders.
	As mentioned above, execute :delete to remove currently selected file (or files).
	To fullscreen a preview window, hit i. Hit i again to return the preview window to it’s normal size.
	Vi’s gg and G allow you to jump to the top and bottom of the file list respectively.
	Hit zh to toggle hidden files display.
	As in Vim, / searches for a file in a current buffer, while n and N let you navigate to the next and previous matches respectively.
	Similarly, :filter allows you to only limit your view to the files matching a pattern. It’s also interactive - changes are applied as you type.

6. Blacklisting:
	
	If there is any inaccessible pages, check "/etc/hosts"

		-v – visual, show files uploaded
		-z – compress files for upload
		-P – if uploading a large file and upload breaks, pick up where we left off rather than reuploading the entire file
